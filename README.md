# Timeseria-notebooks
Example notebooks using [Timeseria](https://github.com/sarusso/Timeseria)  - a time series processing library.

Run with:

    docker run -it -p8888:8888 -v$PWD/notebooks:/notebooks sarusso/timeseria:v0.1.3


Or, install Timeseria (`pip install timeseria==0.1.3`) and use them from your own Jupyter Notebook server.

**Note:** the interactive plotting engine does not work in Jupyter Lab due to recent security restrictions.
