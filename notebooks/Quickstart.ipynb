    "# Timeseria quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "Timeseria is a time series processing library which aims at making it easy to handle time series data and to build statistical and machine learning models on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It comes with a built-in set of common operations (resampling, slotting, differencing etc.) as well as \n",
    "models (reconstruction, forecasting and anomaly detection), and both custom operations and models can be easily plugged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timeseria also tries to address by design all those annoying things which are often left as an implementation detail but that actually cause wasting massive amounts of time - as handling data losses, non-uniform sampling rates, differences between time-slotted data and punctual observations, variable time units, timezones, DST changes and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a (super) quickstart, if you are looking for a more structured introduction, have a look at the [welcome notebook](https://sarusso.github.io/Timeseria/Welcome.html). Also the [reference documentation](https://timeseria.readthedocs.io) might be useful."
